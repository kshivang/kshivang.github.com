## Abstract
A lot has been done in Physics and most of them are done trusting our so-called "fundamentals". These fundamentals originated from philosophical consensus. The philosophical consensus is a result of centuries of philosophical debates. The point I wanted to make in this article is, though our Physics is diversified in a certain manner assuming certain fundamentals, it could be diversified in a completely different way if we assume different fundamental arguments. 

## Introduction
As per today’s knowledge we have reached a significant level of understanding of nature working, journey from Newtonian physics to today's modern physics, there's a lot to proud off, but isn't there a notion that is things really works the same as been told by our great- great scientists, it's really funny to blame them all if they were wrong then today's comfort life that we live might be impossible, the exceptional applications of science in aircraft, in computers would be not possible, but "there  is real existence of but" that there are lots of loopholes in today’s science, as per scientists view, they might say it soon being sort out but there also exist certain blunders in some basics understandings that can't be ignored but as per observations it has been adjusted, all these directly indicate about some deficiency in our pre knowledge.
I am not saying we are absolutely wrong but up to some limits that might will leads us to an edge some day. As per my understanding nobody in this world want to stabilize itself to one position otherwise notion of universe to randomize will finish so we need certain theory that explain everything from its beginning to its end.

## Theory
I once was in great dilemma in thinking of my knowledge I found every single thing that I know was actually for some limit can be felt physically or we can say mentally so I started my journey of thinking of science I tried my best to doing that for several of hours but at last I found I was missing in all fields there was a explanation of  lots of things but still there exist lots of assumptions that are based on practical experiences I get messed then I found the puzzle that I was solving is actually not being in process of solving but too me recollection of some body's puzzles sequence then I started thinking like Adam or Eve who actually have no sense of himself but it's surrounding gave clues to understanding things .

(But as per my some pre somebodies puzzle sequences I was focused to fundamentalist level) I was seeking most appropriate explanation of my thinking ability to fundamental block of things (living or nonliving), time intervals, changes in state, all possible questions then I concluded several things this conclusion was actually link up of my knowledge to thinking ,that is

* Every single thing in this universe is actually being synchronized with everything else 
* Time is also link up with this synchronization and play effective role of randomization

## Implications
Every single things in this universe is in random change I think customized random change and that change is governed by everything-previous state, surrounding state, past state, time state and "some self randomization" ,which is really random, also this randomization is contributed in random manner.

* This thing is applicable for the most basic blocks of matter, energy or just nothingness. I think all these things are changing their state in random manner and all of us are in its transition state.

* At most basic level which is about infinite microcity all things are actually just a random state which is affected by surrounding state even nothing.

* Even our thinking is state which actually being different in next instant as affected by its before state, previous state, surrounding state and conclude itself to situation, that is, present state.

* In similar manner matter changes its state on account of its previous state...also energy or we can say both works on this principality as basically all are same.

* If we talk about nothingness then its logic is also related to all these, which actually exists all time from beginning to end, even nothingness is randomized in a random time interval that we can call, we are in randomized transition in some randomized time interval of all things state.

* This theory also explains about beginning, that is, all things started from nothing or stabilized state then everything randomized also there will be a state in future when everything will again stabilize in some state and everything will come to stable state again then again it will randomize but this might be other randomization even this time interval in between randomizations will be randomized from "ten to the power minus infinite sec to ten to power infinite seconds", question that I found can be explained in this manner.

## Conclusion
Key thing that I realize in my conclusion or we can say that I dig out from my thinking is there can be some nascent perspective of world of our own, it might match with somebody’s thinking or it could be completely different way, I don’t know our past or future with certainty but time in which we leave we want a constructive way out for this great mystery of everything. What so fascinating about “Talking about everything”. The very moment any of us born this question born with us as well why anything and/or everything. 

## Remarks
The philosophy that I used to devise my perspective is irrespective-ness of matter (own irrespective behavioral of state), I think respective quantities are very hypothetical to assume, every state has some extend of own randomness.
